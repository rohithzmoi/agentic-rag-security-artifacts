F1,Semantic Overfetch,Semantic retrieval returns chunks outside user scope due to embedding similarity,Alice (junior HR) queries about Bob's projects; retriever returns both project assignments (authorized) and performance reviews (restricted),Similarity search performed before authorization; access metadata stale or coarse,Section 6.1
F2,Cross-Domain Synthesis Leakage,Aggregation and synthesis leak restricted info by combining partial facts,Alice cannot access salary data but model synthesizes 'Bob earns more than average' from authorized headcount + filtered salary chunks,Individual chunk filtering insufficient; synthesis reveals relationships,Section 6.2
F3,Delegation Escalation,Agent or tool executes under broader privileges than calling user,User-facing agent delegates to 'admin tools' agent with DB write access; calling user read-only scope not propagated,Ambient credentials; service roles; mis-scoped tool access,Section 6.3
F4,Implicit Leakage,Model reveals restricted info indirectly through summarization or inference,Model infers restricted facts from variance in responses over authorized chunks,Authorization-correct retrieval necessary but not sufficient; inference risk,Section 6.4
F5,Audit Incompleteness,System cannot reconstruct which chunks influenced outputs,Compliance requirement to trace data lineage violated despite authorization filtering,Audit log gaps; no provenance tracking through agentic chains,Section 6.5
