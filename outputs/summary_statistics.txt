SUMMARY STATISTICS - SoK Authorization in Multi-Agent RAG
============================================================

O1: Defense families that CANNOT satisfy AFR: 2
    - D3: Post-Retrieval Filtering
    - D4: Prompt Constraints

O2: Defense families with CONDITIONAL AFR: 2
    - D1: Role-Partitioned Indices (Index proliferation; breaks under dynamic roles and cross-role queries)
    - D2: Metadata-Tag Filtering (Tag expressiveness limits; correctness depends on tag freshness)

O3: Defense families with NO delegation correctness: 0

O4: Deployment patterns with FULL AFR support: 1
    - AFR PEP gating retrieval candidates against PDP

O5: NEGATIVE RESULT VERIFICATION
    Checking for patterns with AFR + Delegation + State Isolation...
    CONFIRMED: No pattern achieves all three properties simultaneously
    (AFR PEP pattern achieves AFR+Auth but State Isolation remains Conditional)

FAILURE MODES CLASSIFIED:
    F1: Semantic Overfetch
    F2: Cross-Domain Synthesis Leakage
    F3: Delegation Escalation
    F4: Implicit Leakage
    F5: Audit Incompleteness
    Total failure modes: 5
